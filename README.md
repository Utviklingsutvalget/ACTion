This repository is used for development of the new web application to be used by the Student Society at Westerdals ACT, a private university college in Oslo, Norway. It uses the Play Framework, and is designed with a modular approach to administrating clubs and events in the student society.

## How to test the application
Begin with cloning the repository. Then run the activator script in the project root using the $activator run. Before opening the project in an IDE, make sure to run $activator followed by the command denoting your IDE. For example, $activator idea generates an SBT project for Jetbrains' IntelliJ IDEA.
Please read the documentation and see the README.md located in ./conf/secrets before attempting to test the application properly.
